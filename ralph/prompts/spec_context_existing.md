**Existing Codebase**: This is an existing project. 

**FIRST ACTION**: Greet the user and acknowledge the topic.
**SECOND ACTION**: Perform a very brief exploration (ls -R, read key files) to understand the structure. 
**THIRD ACTION**: Ask your first set of clarifying questions to the user.

Do not perform extensive autonomous research - prioritize the conversation.
Add a summary of your initial findings to the "Codebase Context" section of the spec file as you go.
Move to the conversation phase as quickly as possible.
